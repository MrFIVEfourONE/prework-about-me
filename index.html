      <h1>A little about me:</h1>
      <p>I climbed to the top of a very intresting niche trade as a Gargage Door Installer. Realizing I am not utilizing any of my skills or intrest I decided to go back to school and am currently learning how to code. The doors this will open in my life are insurmountable! </p>
      <h1>Where I hail From:</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Jackson WY</p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies are:</h1>
      <p>I am an avid Mountain Bike rider, build and race electric R/C cars, I love video games, and tinkering or building something with my hands.</p>
      <h1>??!!DREAM JOB!!??</h1>
      <p>I am an entrepreneur, but my dream job would be one that allowed me to build or create. Being an app developer would be ideal, or part of a team behind a major start up. </p>
      <h1>Current Residence</h1>
      <p>I consider myself an Oregon transplant, and currently live in Prineville with my Beautiful soon to be wife.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a "web developer"?</h1>
